# Plant Health Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture ðŸŒ±

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and documentation for the Plant Health Detection System, a project aimed at revolutionizing sustainable agriculture through AI-powered plant disease detection. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a diverse dataset of plant images, the system identifies and classifies plant diseases with high accuracy, providing actionable insights for farmers and agricultural professionals.

## Features:

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes CNNs for automated feature extraction and disease classification.

Real-Time Diagnostics: Interactive web application built with Streamlit for uploading plant images and receiving disease predictions.

High Accuracy: Achieves over 97% classification accuracy on a diverse dataset of plant leaf images.

Sustainability Focus: Promotes targeted treatment to minimize pesticide use and improve crop yields.

Scalability: Designed to support additional crops and diseases with future model updates.


## Project Highlights:

Dataset: Preprocessed images of healthy and diseased plants.

Frameworks: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pillow, and Streamlit.

Deployment: User-friendly web application for real-time usage.

Future Scope: Incorporates plans for IoT integration, multilingual support, and cloud-based deployment.
